I ended up doing a mix of the two difficulties. I wanted to do different pages with radio buttons, but I didn't do the Start Over reset at the end.

I added audio for fun, and also when the timer clock runs out for each question, the radio buttons disable. It doesn't automatically go to the next question, but the player cannot answer, so I thought that was good enough.
